## Compatability
### Confirmed Working
#### Tower Fans
* DR-HTF001S
* DR-HTF002S
* DR-HTF004S
* DR-HTF005S
* DR-HTF007S
#### Table Fans
* DR-HAF004S

Please let me know if you have another model that works or doesn't work. The plugin *should* also be compatible with multiple devices on the same account but I haven't tested this. Non-fan smart devices are not supported at this time, but if you have another device and can help me test some code out I would definitely be open to adding support.
## Installation
```
npm i @miblanchard/homebridge-dreo
```
(Or install through the Homebridge UI)

## Configuration
Provide your Dreo app login credentials
```json
{
  "platforms": [
    {
      "options": {
         "email": "email@example.com",
         "password": "00000000"
      },
      "name": "Dreo Platform",
      "platform": "DreoPlatform",
    }
  ]
}
```
